      "description": "Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a lowered total amount of ozone in Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone (the ozone layer) around Earth&#x27;s polar regions.

      "description": "Ground-level ozone (O3), also known as surface-level ozone and tropospheric ozone, is a trace gas in the troposphere (the lowest level of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere), with an average concentration of 20â€“30 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with close to 100 ppbv in polluted areas. Ozone is also an important constituent of the stratosphere, where the ozone layer ...",

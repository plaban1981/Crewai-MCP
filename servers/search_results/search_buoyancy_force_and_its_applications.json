      "description": "You find a balance point, called ... buoyant force. Adding to the complexity, things like lung capacity, body composition, and salinity of the water can all influence buoyancy. Saltwater, for instance, is denser than freshwater, which is why itâ€™s easier to float in the ocean than in a swimming pool. One of the most visually impressive applications of buoyancy ...",

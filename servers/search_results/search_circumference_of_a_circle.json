      "description": "The area of a regular polygon is half its perimeter multiplied by the distance from its center to its sides, and because the sequence tends to a circle, the corresponding formula–that the area is half the circumference times the radius–namely, A = ⁠1/2⁠ × 2πr × r, holds for a circle.",

      "description": "Angles in the Same Segment: Angles in the same segment of a circle (i.e., angles subtended by the same chord on the same side) are equal. The core formulas are described by these relationships: If an arc subtends an angle $x$ at the center, it subtends an angle $x/2$ at any point on the major arc. If $\\angle APB$ and $\\angle AQB$ are angles in the same segment, then $\\angle APB = \\angle AQB$. (A, B are points on the circumference ...",
